# Natterberry

Safe language practice for refugee youth.

## What is this?

Natterberry is a Flutter application which helps refugees practice language with volunteers. While there are many language exchange apps, they are problematic for refugee youth for several reasons:

- NGOs and guardians have a duty of care to minors when using applications on devices they often provide. Natterberry fixes this by providing a validation path for volunteers to provide a "Working With Children" document.
- Most language apps and exchanges are designed for people who have competence in one language already and are swapping expertise to learn a new langauge. Refugee youth need an "asymettrical" exchange, they need to access people willing to listen, but may not be able to contribute to that persons learning. Natterberry helps because it onboards volunteers who want to match and help refugees.
- Focus on video. Refugee youth typically have very poor internet access. Instead Natterberry focuses on audio.
- Language exchange apps can have a dating focus. By controlling volunteers and limiting access to information in matches to only what's relevant, Natterberry keeps the focus on language practice.

## How can I help

As you can see from the repository, there's not much here yet! We're just getting started. I'm working to speak with NGOs here in Athens, Greece that work with refugees to further scope and define the requirements, building out some prototype screens. If you're interested in helping refugee youth with a tool that will help them improve their opportunities through improving their language skills, I'd love to hear from you!
